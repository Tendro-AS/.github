### Our story

Tendro is a startup from NTNU School of Entrepreneurship, developing procurment support tools for the construction industry. The Norwegian construction industry alone spends between 1,42-7,59 billion EUR each year on procurement. Our product has a great potential reducing the total cost, by eliminating unnecessary processes such as formating conversion and in-prosess communications.

The concept has been developed since February 2022, and we are currently working on our pilot project. The beachhead customers we are targeting are small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, in the Norwegian construction industry. Our plan for the next year is to: develop a prototype communication and delegation platform that integrates the builder, entrepreneur, and subcontractor into the same platform.

Adjacent to the prototyping, we are executing a partnership with the NTNU Institute of Construction, where we have access to academia and entrepreneurs who may participate in project trials. We will use the prototypes and this network to start pilot projects by the end of the year.

Our business model is subscription-based, adding value to the customer by reducing the time, resources, and risk spent on construction procurement.
